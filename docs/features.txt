::
A post-training impact assessment tool for organizations that tracks 
the effectiveness of corporate trainings, team-building workshops, 
and any form of formal or informal non-technical learning interventions.
::

Designed and implemented the complete Frontend and Backend

Some key functionalities I implemented include content sharing, user roles, 
social elements such as liking and commenting, notifications,
email, file sharing, etc.

I also handled bug fixes and patches, custom features for clients, 
automatic backups and maintenance.

Opening Day Movie Tickets

A small script I wrote in <b>Python</b> that played a song (alert), when the box office opened after midnight, for the premiere of <b>Batman vs Superman: The Dawn of Justice</b>. It worked by scraping websites of a few online ticket booking services repeatedly through the night, every few seconds.

Sudoku Solver

An application <b>I wrote in Highschool</b> using <i>Visual Basic 6.0</i>, that solves Sudoku puzzles by listing possibilites in a 3-dimensional array, eliminating them, at times retracing steps back, etc to arrive at a solution.

3D-plotting Tool

An application <b>I wrote in Highschool</b> using <i>Visual Basic 6.0</i>, that reads 3-dimensional coordinates for vertices and edges, and plots them in a window, with <b>perspective distortion</b> etc. The plotted objects could be then rotated by dragging the cursor over the object. It also handled some basic coloring of planes, but it turned out to be quite sluggish as the shading library was entirely written by me in Visual Basic.
